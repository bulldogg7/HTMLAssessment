	<p class="font40">In Final Fantasy 7, you play as Cloud Strife, a mercenary who joins an eco-terrorist group called Avalanche to fight against the powerful corporation Shinra, which is draining the planet's life force for energy; the story follows Cloud and his allies as they pursue Sephiroth, a powerful and dangerous individual who seeks to further harm the planet and achieve god-like status, while uncovering the truth about Cloud's past and his connection to the planet's life essence.</p>
	<p>In Final Fantasy VIII, the player takes on the role of Squall Leonhart, a student at a mercenary training academy called Balamb Garden, who gets caught up in a global conflict when a powerful sorceress named Edea Kramer takes control of a military state; as Squall and his comrades battle against her forces, he grapples with his leadership role and develops a relationship with fellow SeeD member Rinoa Heartilly, while uncovering the true mastermind behind Edea's actions, a time-manipulating sorceress from the future named Ultimecia, who seeks to compress time itself.</p>
